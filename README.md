## Machine Learning predicitons in Web app

Working on approach to use Tensorflow.js library for real time predictions in an web app.

MNIST is a popular dataset of images of handwritten digits [link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

There are various models to predict Handwritten Digits. This project uses a Convolution 2D model to predict the digits. 
The dataset has various images to train the model. If this model is deployed on a web application then the trained ML model can be used to predict digits written on browser.
