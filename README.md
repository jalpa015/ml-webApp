## Machine Learning predicitons in Web app

Working on approach to use Tensorflow.js library for real time predictions in an web app.

MNIST is a popular dataset of images of handwritten digits [link](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

There are various models to predict Handwritten Digits. This project uses a Convolution 2D model to predict the digits. 
The dataset has various images to train the model. If this model is deployed on a web application then the trained ML model can be used to predict digits written on browser. 

### Key Features about the project -
    
    * Uses Conv2D model to predict handwritten digits
    * Deployed ML model to Node.js WebApp
    * Integrated model predictions in JavaScript code
    * Developed CI pipeline for Master branch

### Getting Started - 

To get started with the project follow the below metioned steps - 

    * This project requires Node.js.
    * In the terminal of project folder, type npm install to install the dependencies.
    * Once the dependencies are installed, type npm start to run the project locally.
    * You can see the app on localhost:4545/ in your browser.

#### Editing the ML model

    * To edit the ML model you will need pip to install the Python packages. 
    * Once pip is installed in your computer, install the libraries.
    * Now the Jupyter Notebook can be edited.
